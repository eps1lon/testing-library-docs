<summary>Why "Web" in "Web Testing Library</summary>

This library implements testing utilities that are used on different clients
implementing the
[Minimum Common Web Platform API](https://proposal-common-min-api.deno.dev/) (or
parts of it). This includes browsers, Node.js, Deno and React Native.

React Native is included for pragmatic reasons. In the future, we might split
the utilities up in Web and Timer testing utilities.
