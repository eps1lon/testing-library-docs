## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for the
[Web Platform](https://proposal-common-min-api.deno.dev/) or React Native. As a
part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details
of your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence
for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your testbase to be
maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to
implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and
your team down.

## This solution

The `Web Testing Library` is a very light-weight solution for testing code that
runs on the Web Platform (a browser, [Node.js][node], [Deno](https://deno.land/)
etc) or React Native. The main utilities it provides involve querying the DOM
for nodes in a way that's similar to how the user finds elements on the page. In
this way, the library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI
code. The `DOM Testing Library`'s primary guiding principle is:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.

We try to only expose methods and utilities that encourage you to write tests
that closely resemble how your code is used on the Web Platform or React Native.

Utilities are included in this project based on the following guiding
principles:

1. They should be usable on both the Web Platform **and** React Native
2. It should be generally useful for testing the application in the way the user
   would use it. We _are_ making some trade-offs here because we're using a
   computer and often a simulated environment, but in general, utilities should
   encourage tests that use the application the way they're intended to be used.
3. Utility implementations and APIs should be simple and flexible.

**What this library is not**:

1.  A test runner or framework
2.  Specific to a testing framework (though we do have better defaults for Jest
    like support for fake timers).
